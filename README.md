# E-Commerce Back-End

## License
This project is licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/MIT).


## Description
This is a back-end of an internet retail, also known as "e-commerce", site. I took a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a PostgreSQL database. See the walkthrough video to see how we are able to create, update, and delete data in the database.
